// Custom TTRPG System

// Working on creating a custom System based loosely on DnD 3.5e, Pathfinder (1 & 2), and GURPS. Alongside this, working on creating an interactive site/tool to more easily visualize the rules and character growth options.

// Plenty of small ideas here, but namely playing around with concepts like a DIY dashcam or Media Control Screen.
